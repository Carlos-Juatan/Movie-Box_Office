## Project Description

Movie-Box_Office is a study project focused on creating a landing page for movie ticket sales (in this case, for The Batman film). The main objective is to practice building an attractive and informative web page designed to encourage users to purchase tickets for the movie. The project features different sections organized across separate pages, including a catchy banner, a movie introduction with a trailer, and an area highlighting the main actors.
